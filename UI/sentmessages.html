                                            Hey dude! It’s a new day. A day to make a difference. You know I’ve got your back man. Good morning.
                                            At any point today, if you feel discouraged and lack the will to continue, give me a call. 
                                            I’ll remind you of your awesomeness and all the wonderful things you’re capable of. Good morning.

                                            I needed to let you know that. Good morning dear friend.
                                            There are certain people that bring sunshine with them, you are one of such. 
                                            Thoughts of you light up my face always. Good morning dear friend.
                                            May all your dreams come true today. May all your aspirations be met. 
                                            May life direct beautiful things your way, for no one deserves goodness as much as you do. Good Morning dear friend. Have a good day.
                                            You’re one of the rarest, truest friends I’ve ever met.
